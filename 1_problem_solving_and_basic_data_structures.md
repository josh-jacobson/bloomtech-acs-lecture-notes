# Sprint 1: Problem Solving and Basic Data Structures

## Data Types in Java

### Strings
* List (ordered collection, data types can be heterogeneous. Similar to a js array)
* Dictionary (key-value pairs. Similar to a js object)
* Array (ordered collection, all elements must be same data type)
* Set (unordered collection, no duplicate values)

Iterables: List, Tuple, String, Dictionary and Set.
(Also any objects you define with an __iter__() or __getitem()__ method)

### Arrays
